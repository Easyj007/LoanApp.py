# LoanApp.py
This is a web app built using python, streamlit and scikit-learn to predict loan default flags. It uses a trained machine learning model to evaluate loan and customer information to show whether a loan is a good or bad flag. This project was completed as a practical assignment during the Data Science course offered by Axia Africa.
